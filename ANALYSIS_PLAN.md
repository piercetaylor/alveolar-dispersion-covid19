# Analysis Plan — Manuscript-Grade Study Design

## Dispersion, Not Displacement: Loss of Alveolar Epithelial State Coherence in Lethal COVID-19

**Paper v3 revision: 2026-04-30**

---

## 1. Refined Aims

### Aim 1 (Primary): Test competing geometric models of epithelial injury

**Objective:** Distinguish between coherent centroid displacement (all cells shift toward one damaged state) and dispersion-dominated fan-out (cells scatter heterogeneously) in lethal COVID-19 alveolar epithelium. The primary inferential unit is the **donor**, not the cell.

**Primary analyses:**
- Dispersion: within-group variance comparison (Levene's test) — **primary metric**
- Centroid distance: COVID vs healthy distance to healthy centroid (Mann-Whitney U) — **pre-registered, expected negative**
- Donor-level pseudotime: per-donor median pseudotime comparison
- Donor-level bootstrap CIs for pseudotime shift and dispersion ratio
- Nearest-neighbor condition mixing score

**Donor-aware analyses (essential for paper_v3):**
- Donor-level summary table: median pseudotime, IQR, dispersion, frac_transitional, program scores per donor (`src/donor_models.py`)
- Donor-level Mann-Whitney for all key metrics
- Donor-level bootstrap CIs (10,000 resamples of donors, not cells) for pseudotime shift and dispersion ratio
- OLS or mixed-effects model: median_pseudotime ~ is_covid (donor-level)
- Per-donor dispersion comparison (median distance to own-group centroid)

**Secondary analyses:**
- AT1-specific and AT2-specific displacement (do they differ?)
- Donor-stratified displacement (is the effect consistent?)

### Aim 2 (Primary): Reconstruct the failure trajectory and characterize gene program dynamics

**Objective:** Test whether alveolar cells distribute along a continuous pseudotime trajectory with ordered activation of stress, repair, and apoptosis programs.

**Primary analyses:**
- Diffusion pseudotime (DPT) rooted in healthy AT2 centroid
- Gene program scoring (8 programs) along pseudotime
- Pseudotime density comparison: COVID vs healthy (permutation test)
- Program activation ordering: test whether interferon peaks before inflammation, inflammation before repair, repair before apoptosis

**Secondary analyses:**
- Branching analysis: does the trajectory bifurcate (repair vs death)?
- Individual marker gene trends along pseudotime (Spearman correlation)
- Differential expression analysis along pseudotime (GAM-based)

### Aim 3 (Sensitivity): Ablation and robustness validation

**Objective:** Determine which findings survive systematic perturbation of analytical choices.

**Primary analyses:**
- 10 ablation experiments (see Section 6)
- Leave-one-donor-out stability assessment

**Secondary analyses:**
- Random gene-set controls for program scoring
- UMAP random-seed stability
- Comparison to published findings on SCP1219

## 2. Operational Definitions

### Homeostasis
Operationally defined as the transcriptomic state of alveolar epithelial cells from healthy donors. Identified as cells with:
- Condition label = "Healthy"
- High expression of canonical identity markers (SFTPC for AT2, AGER for AT1)
- Low expression of stress/apoptosis programs
- Located in the dense core of the healthy cell distribution in PCA space

### Robustness loss
Defined by convergence of five criteria (all must be assessed; no single criterion is sufficient):

| # | Criterion | Metric | Test |
|---|-----------|--------|------|
| 1 | Displacement from homeostasis | Distance to healthy centroid | Mann-Whitney U, COVID > Healthy |
| 2 | Increased dispersion | Within-group variance | Levene's test |
| 3 | Loss of identity markers | SFTPC, AGER decline along pseudotime | Spearman rho < 0, p < 0.05 |
| 4 | Ordered program activation | Interferon peak < inflammation peak < repair peak < apoptosis peak | Peak position comparison |
| 5 | Stalled differentiation | KRT8/CLDN4 elevated at intermediate pseudotime in COVID cells | Enrichment test at intermediate bins |

### Transitional / failed-repair state
Cells meeting ALL of the following:
- Pseudotime in the middle tertile (33rd–66th percentile)
- KRT8 expression > median AND/OR CLDN4 expression > median
- AT2 identity score declining but not zero
- AT1 identity score partially activated but not at healthy AT1 levels
- Predominantly from COVID donors

### Apoptosis-associated terminal state
Cells meeting:
- Pseudotime in the top decile (>90th percentile)
- Apoptosis program score > 75th percentile
- AT2 and AT1 identity scores in bottom quartile
- Stress program scores elevated

## 3. Statistical Analysis Plan

### 3.1 Sample size and power
The dataset contains ~20,000+ alveolar epithelial cells. For the primary displacement test (Mann-Whitney U comparing ~15,000 COVID vs ~5,000 healthy cells), statistical power is effectively 1.0 for any biologically meaningful effect. The concern is not statistical power but rather whether observed effects are biologically meaningful and robust to analytical variation (hence the extensive ablation plan).

**Emphasis:** We focus on effect sizes, not just p-values. With N > 20,000, trivially small effects will be statistically significant. We will report:
- Effect size (rank-biserial r for Mann-Whitney U)
- Cohen's d for mean differences
- Confidence intervals for all point estimates
- Visualization of distributions, not just summary statistics

### 3.2 Multiple testing
- Gene-level pseudotime trend tests: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction at α = 0.05
- Program-level tests: 8 programs tested; Bonferroni correction applied (effective α = 0.00625)
- Ablation comparisons: not multiplicity-corrected (each is an independent sensitivity check, not a hypothesis test)

### 3.3 Primary statistical tests

| Analysis | Test | Null hypothesis | Alternative | Correction |
|----------|------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| Displacement | Mann-Whitney U | COVID distance = Healthy distance | COVID > Healthy | None (single primary test) |
| Dispersion | Levene's test | Var(COVID) = Var(Healthy) | Var(COVID) > Var(Healthy) | None |
| Pseudotime enrichment | Permutation test (N=1000) | Condition labels independent of pseudotime | COVID enriched at high pseudotime | None |
| Gene trend | Spearman correlation | No monotonic trend along pseudotime | Trend exists | BH FDR |
| Program ordering | Peak pseudotime comparison | Random ordering | Interferon < inflammation < repair < apoptosis | Descriptive |
| Donor consistency | Kruskal-Wallis | All donors same pseudotime distribution | Variation exists | By condition |

### 3.4 Sensitivity analysis framework
Each ablation produces a "core metric" that is compared to the primary analysis. Core metrics:
1. Median pseudotime difference (COVID - Healthy)
2. Program ordering (rank correlation of peak positions with expected ordering)
3. Displacement effect size (rank-biserial r)

An ablation "passes" if the core metric retains the same sign and the same qualitative conclusion. Quantitative differences are expected and reported.

## 4. Primary vs Secondary vs Sensitivity Analyses

### Primary (publication-critical)
These are the analyses that directly test the central hypothesis. If these fail, the paper does not exist.

1. Alveolar epithelial manifold construction and condition comparison
2. Pseudotime trajectory reconstruction
3. Gene program scoring and ordering along pseudotime
4. Displacement and dispersion quantification
5. Transitional state characterization

### Secondary (strengthening but not required)
These add depth but the paper stands without them.

6. AT1 vs AT2 separate trajectory analysis
7. Branching/fate analysis
8. Differential expression along pseudotime
9. Comparison to published findings

### Sensitivity (Aim 3 — validation)
These determine the confidence level of the primary findings.

10. All 10 ablation experiments
11. Permutation controls
12. Random gene-set controls
13. Leave-one-donor-out
14. UMAP stability

### Ablation 4: Remove apoptosis genes

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| What changes | Exclude apoptosis program genes from HVG list before manifold construction |
| Why it matters | Tests whether trajectory is a death gradient or a multi-faceted process |
| Compare | Trajectory persistence; non-apoptotic program ordering |
| Strengthens if | Trajectory and non-apoptotic ordering preserved |

## 7. Threat-to-Validity Assessment

### Internal validity threats

| Threat | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Cross-sectional design** | Fundamental | Cannot prove temporal dynamics. All findings framed as "consistent with" staged process. Pseudotime is an ordering inference, not a time measurement. |
| **Donor confounding** | High | Batch correction (Harmony); leave-one-donor-out analysis; donor-stratified reporting |
| **Annotation error** | High | Marker gene validation before any analysis; re-annotation if needed |
| **Embedding artifacts** | Moderate | Compare UMAP vs diffusion maps; test UMAP seed stability; avoid quantitative analysis on UMAP coordinates |
| **Pseudotime root sensitivity** | Moderate | Test 4 different root cells; report whether ordering is stable |
| **Batch-correction artifacts** | Moderate | Compare with and without correction; avoid over-correction |
| **Ambient RNA contamination** | Moderate | Check for unexpected marker expression in wrong cell types; healthy cells scoring high on injury programs |
| **Apoptotic cell dropout** | Moderate | snRNA-seq captures nuclei from dead cells better than scRNA-seq; the most apoptotic cells may still be underrepresented |
| **Gene set arbitrariness** | Moderate | Test alternative gene set definitions; random gene set controls |
| **Multiple testing** | Low | BH FDR correction; Bonferroni for program-level tests; emphasis on effect sizes |
| **Ablation coverage gap** (found 2026-08-25) | Moderate | `displacement_effect_size` not re-tested under 5/10 ablations' own embeddings (02/03/05/08/09) — `centroid_distance()` (`src/stats.py`) defaults to `rep_key="X_pca"`; mitigation: §9 Follow-up 2 / RUNBOOK Step 14 |
| **Cell-type composition sensitivity** (found 2026-08-25) | Moderate | Ablation 1 (AT2-only) flips displacement sign (r = +0.14 → -0.29); mitigation: §9 Follow-up 3 / RUNBOOK Step 15 |
| **Unvalidated mechanism regression** (found 2026-08-25) | Moderate | `results/v3/fan_out_contribution.csv` is unregularized OLS with no p-values or cross-validation; mitigation: §9 Follow-up 4 / RUNBOOK Step 16 |

### External validity threats

| Threat | Severity | Note |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Single dataset** | High | All findings are specific to SCP1219 until replicated in independent cohorts |
| **Lethal COVID-19 only** | High | No mild/moderate cases for comparison; cannot determine if findings are specific to lethal disease or general to COVID |
| **Unknown disease duration** | Moderate | Time from infection to death varies; "pseudotime" within the tissue may not align with clinical timeline |
| **Post-mortem artifacts** | Low-Moderate | Tissue collected post-mortem; gene expression may not fully reflect ante-mortem biology |
| **Generalizability to other injuries** | Speculative | Claims about "robustness collapse" as a general principle require validation in other DAD contexts |
| **Replication cohort gene-panel restriction** (found 2026-08-25) | Moderate | The 84-gene panel supports program-score composites and marker-threshold assays but cannot support manifold/DPT reconstruction; a genuine full-transcriptome replication is untested. §9 Follow-up 1 / RUNBOOK Step 13 |

### What this study cannot claim
1. That individual cells traverse the inferred pseudotime trajectory
2. That the observed gene program ordering reflects real temporal dynamics
3. Causality between any molecular program and cell fate
4. That findings generalize beyond lethal COVID-19
5. Therapeutic targets or intervention points (without experimental validation)

### What this study can claim (paper_v3 revision)
1. That COVID-19 alveolar cells show dispersion-dominated loss of state coherence, not coherent centroid displacement
2. That within-group dispersion is the most portable cross-cohort signature of alveolar injury
3. That a donor-aware pseudotime shift exists and is amplified by batch correction
4. That a KRT8+/CLDN4+ transitional population is enriched in the primary atlas (but not portable under marker thresholds)
5. That identity-program decline with pseudotime is stable; fine injury-program ordering is hypothesis-generating
6. That these findings are robust to ablation, cross-method validation (Palantir), and independent replication — **with one qualifier (found 2026-08-25):** the displacement metric specifically was only genuinely re-tested by half the ablation grid (5/10 ablations reused a cached primary-run value rather than recomputing under their own embedding); the dispersion and pseudotime-shift findings are not affected. See §7 internal validity threats and §9 Follow-up 2

## 8. Paper v3 Extension Analyses

### 8.1 Donor-aware inference (Essential)
- Module: `src/donor_models.py`
- Analyses: donor_summary, donor_level_test, donor_bootstrap_ci, donor_dispersion_comparison, mixed_effects_pseudotime, pseudobulk_expression
- Status (2026-08-25): Run. Outputs: `results/v3/donor_summary.csv`, `donor_level_tests.json`, `donor_bootstrap_ci.json`, `mixed_effects.json`, `donor_dispersion*.{json,csv}`; results integrated into `manuscript/paper_v3.tex`

### 8.2 Portable state score (High value)
- Module: `src/state_score.py`
- Analyses: at2_identity_score, at1_identity_score, transitional_score, injury_composite_score, coherence_loss_score, repair_failure_score, benchmark_scores
- Status (2026-08-25): Run. Outputs: `results/v3/state_scores.csv`, `state_score_benchmarks.csv`, `replication_state_benchmarks.csv`

### 8.3 Mechanistic linkage (Medium value)
- Module: `src/mechanism.py`
- Analyses: program_geometry_linkage, repair_stall_analysis, local_heterogeneity, fan_out_contribution
- Status (2026-08-25): Run. Outputs: `results/v3/program_geometry_linkage.csv`, `fan_out_contribution.csv`, `repair_stall.json`. Caveat: `fan_out_contribution.csv` is an unregularized OLS with no p-values/cross-validation in the saved file — see §9 Follow-up 4

### 8.4 Cross-disease generalization (Ambitious / future)
- Module: `src/generalization.py`
- Plan: `docs/GENERALIZATION_PLAN.md` (see its dated status header, 2026-08-25)
- Status: Code scaffold implemented; external data not downloaded

### 8.5 Orthogonal validation (Future work)
- Plan: `docs/ORTHOGONAL_VALIDATION_PLAN.md` (see its dated status header, 2026-08-25)
- Status: Plan only; requires spatial, pathology, or RNA velocity data. Exception: Ablation 9 (Palantir, an alternative trajectory algorithm) is complete — orthogonal-validation-adjacent but belongs to the ablations suite, not to this plan's O1–O4

## 9. Post-Hoc Validation Follow-Ups (2026-08-25)

Identified via a critical review of `paper_v3.tex` against its own ablation and replication results, cross-referenced against comparable published literature (Watson et al. 2023, *Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol*; dispersion-metrics assessment, *PLOS Comp Bio* 2025). Not yet executed; tracked here for prioritization, and made executable in `RUNBOOK.md` Steps 13–16. Two of the four (Follow-ups 1 and 4) are new experiments and use the §5 Experiment template; the other two (Follow-ups 2 and 3) are ablation-grid work and use the §6 Ablation template — each follow-up uses whichever template actually fits its shape, rather than one template for all four.

### Follow-up 1: Expand the replication gene panel beyond 84 genes

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Purpose | Test whether the primary finding (dispersion, donor-level pseudotime direction) replicates under a genuine full/expanded manifold reconstruction, not just program-score composites computed from a restricted gene panel |
| Input | `cellxgene_census` (public, no-login API; 921,510 raw alveolar cells available, full transcriptome, per `scripts/replication/analyze_replication.py`'s docstring) |
| Method | Edit `scripts/replication/fetch_replication.py`'s `gene_shortlist` (currently `config.yaml`'s gene-program genes + a fixed marker list, lines 31–43 — a pragmatic "<1GB download" choice per the code's own comment, not a data-source limitation) to include either a much larger HVG-driven gene set or the full transcriptome, re-fetch, and re-run `analyze_replication.py`'s dispersion/pseudotime-surrogate/DATP tests plus (if feasible) a genuine DPT/manifold reconstruction on the expanded cohort. *See RUNBOOK.md Step 13.* |
| Primary output | Re-fetched `data/replication/replication_alveolar.h5ad` (expanded panel); refreshed `results/replication/replication_metrics.json` |
| Plots | Updated Fig 7 (replication summary) — expanded-panel variant; see `FIGURE_PLAN.md` |
| Tables | `results/tables/tableS9_replication_expanded_panel.csv`; see `TABLE_PLAN.md` |
| Code module | `scripts/replication/fetch_replication.py`, `scripts/replication/analyze_replication.py` |
| Failure mode | If dispersion and donor-level direction do NOT replicate under a genuine manifold reconstruction (vs. the current program-score-composite surrogate), that would substantially weaken the "most portable finding" claim and require re-examining whether the 84-gene program-composite approach was itself introducing an artifact |

### Follow-up 2: Fix the frozen displacement-effect-size bug and re-run all 10 ablations

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| What changes | Fix `centroid_distance()` call sites (`src/stats.py`) in the ablation runner to pass each ablation's actual embedding (`X_pca_harmony` for #03, UMAP/diffmap for #02, etc.) instead of the default `rep_key="X_pca"`; then re-run all 10 ablations once real primary SCP1219 data is available locally. *See RUNBOOK.md Step 14.* |
| Why it matters | `displacement_effect_size` is currently identical (r=0.1407) across 10 of 14 ablation-variant rows in `results/tables/tableS6_ablation_summary.csv` — 5 of 10 ablations (02 embedding, 03 batch-correction, 05 root-strategy, 08 gene-program, 09 Palantir) never actually re-tested displacement under their own perturbation. `paper_v3.tex` line 222 claims displacement was "never significant... across all ablations" — this needs to be genuinely true, not an artifact of a caching bug |
| Compare | Re-computed `displacement_effect_size` per ablation vs. the current frozen `r=0.1407` |
| Strengthens if | Displacement stays non-significant (opposite-to-hypothesized or null) under every ablation's own embedding — confirms the robustness claim is genuine, not a caching artifact |
| Weakens if | Any ablation's re-computed displacement effect size becomes significant in the hypothesized direction (COVID > Healthy) once actually re-tested under its own embedding — the "displacement never significant across all ablations" claim in `paper_v3.tex` would need to be revised or caveated |
| Output files | `results/tables/tableS6_ablation_summary.csv` (regenerated) |

### Follow-up 3: Disclose or investigate ablation 1's (AT2-only) displacement sign flip

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| What changes | Investigate why AT1-cell removal (Ablation 1, AT2-only) flips the displacement sign; add this ablation's displacement result explicitly to the manuscript's robustness discussion. *See RUNBOOK.md Step 15.* |
| Why it matters | `results/ablations/01_at2_only/metrics.json` shows displacement effect size flips sign entirely under AT2-only restriction (r = +0.14 in the primary analysis vs. r ≈ -0.29 for AT2-only) — this is not mentioned anywhere in `paper_v3.tex`'s ablation robustness discussion (Results §"Ablation analyses distinguish robust from fragile conclusions"), which currently only lists LODO/embedding/batch-correction/apoptosis-removal as tested for displacement robustness |
| Compare | AT2-only displacement effect size and its interpretation vs. the primary (AT1+AT2+transitional) analysis's r=+0.14 |
| Strengthens if | The sign flip is explained by a specific, non-artifactual AT1-vs-AT2 geometric difference (e.g. AT1 cells' distance-to-healthy-centroid distribution is systematically different) and disclosed with that explanation |
| Weakens if | The sign flip reflects a genuine, unexplained AT1-vs-AT2 asymmetry — the manuscript's claim that displacement failure is "a robust feature of the data, not an artifact of a single pipeline choice" (line 222) needs a caveat specific to cell-type composition |
| Output files | Manuscript revision (Results/Discussion) — no new data file; source is the existing `results/ablations/01_at2_only/metrics.json` |

### Follow-up 4: Strengthen or soften the mechanism-regression claim

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Purpose | `results/v3/fan_out_contribution.csv` (senescence coeff 6.83, oxidative_stress 3.83, nfkb_inflammatory 1.95 as top contributors to the fan-out/dispersion pattern) is an unregularized OLS with no p-values or cross-validation reported in the underlying file. `paper_v3.tex` already hedges this correctly (R²=0.11, described as "a partial mechanistic interpretation," line 277) but a reader checking the raw file would find less rigor than the manuscript framing implies |
| Input | `results/v3/fan_out_contribution.csv`; the underlying program-score/distance-to-centroid data it was regressed from |
| Method | Either add significance testing (e.g. permutation-based p-values on regression coefficients) and cross-validation (e.g. train/test split or k-fold R²) to `src/mechanism.py`'s `fan_out_contribution()` function and re-run, or further soften `paper_v3.tex`'s mechanistic-decomposition language to more explicitly flag it as exploratory/hypothesis-generating rather than a validated finding. *See RUNBOOK.md Step 16.* |
| Primary output | Re-run `results/v3/fan_out_contribution.csv` with added p-value/CV columns, OR a manuscript text revision softening the Discussion's "Mechanistic decomposition" paragraph |
| Plots | None required (optional: a coefficient-CI plot if significance testing is added) |
| Tables | `results/v3/fan_out_contribution.csv` (regenerated with p-values/CV, if that path is taken) |
| Code module | `src/mechanism.py` → `fan_out_contribution()` |
| Failure mode | If coefficients don't survive permutation testing or cross-validated R² is near zero, the "mechanistic decomposition" paragraph in the Discussion should be substantially caveated or removed rather than presented as a partial-but-real mechanistic finding |
